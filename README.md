# Alok's Airflow Practice

## Overview

This repository contains various practice Apache Airflow Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) that showcase different features and techniques of Airflow. These DAGs were created as part of my learning and exploration of Apache Airflow.

## Practice DAGs

The following files are included in this repository:

- **`groups`**: Example of using task groups in Airflow.
- **`sql`**: SQL-related tasks and examples.
- **`subdag`**: Demonstrates the use of SubDAGs in Airflow.
- **`.airflowignore`**: Specifies files and directories to ignore.
- **`brsdag.py`**: Example DAG file.
- **`cleaning_dag.py`**: DAG for data cleaning tasks.
- **`dag1.py`**: Example DAG file.
- **`dag2.py`**: Example DAG file.
- **`dag3_dag.py`**: Example DAG file.
- **`dynamic_task_mapping_dag.py`**: Shows dynamic task mapping in Airflow.
- **`example_dag_advanced.py`**: Advanced DAG showcasing various features.
- **`example_dag_basic.py`**: Basic DAG example.
- **`parent_dag.py`**: Demonstrates parent DAG functionality.
- **`pool_practice_dag.py`**: Practice DAG for Airflow pools.
- **`practice_dag.py`**: General practice DAG file.
- **`process_dag.py`**: DAG for process management.
- **`simple_dag.py`**: Simple example DAG.
- **`taskgroup2_dag.py`**: Example DAG using task groups.
- **`taskgroup_dag.py`**: Another example of task groups.
- **`training_model_dag.py`**: DAG for model training tasks.

These files reflect my practice with Apache Airflow and demonstrate various functionalities and best practices.

## Getting Started

To start working with these DAGs, follow these steps:

1. **Install Apache Airflow:**
   Ensure you have Apache Airflow installed. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install apache-airflow
   ```

2. **Set Up Your Airflow Environment:**
   Initialize the Airflow database and start the Airflow web server and scheduler:

   ```bash
   airflow db init
   airflow webserver --daemon
   airflow scheduler --daemon
   ```

3. **Add DAGs:**
   Copy the DAG files from this repository to your Airflow DAGs folder. By default, this is located at `~/airflow/dags`.

4. **Access Airflow UI:**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`. Log in with your Airflow credentials to view and manage the DAGs.
